Borealis AI is Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s industrial AI research lab.  At first, it seemed like an awkward place to have an AI lab given that most labs are part of some consumer facing tech company, but after thinking about it a bit more it makes a lot of sense.  On the one hand, traditional banks are getting disrupted from many different sides, evidenced by the numerous fintechs, so they need to adopt innovative technologies or risk falling behind (in the long term).  On the other hand, large banks (like RBC) have the scale to make small improvements matter.  In the same way that a slight improvement in Google\u2019s ad system can create tens of millions of dollars in value, adopting AI at scale in a large bank can also lead to some potentially high returns as well.  One hypothesis that I have is that you need this massive scale in order to make this type of industrial AI research lab viable (or I guess a never ending source of VC funding?).

A larger portion of their time is spent doing non-technical work such as meeting with other stakeholders and translating that into work that individual contributors can do.  I don\u2019t think this is specifically a data science problem, but a problem with any function that is deeply technical.  Others who are not specialists in the field will not be able to understand the technical subject matter and, more importantly, translate the overall project requirements into technical work.

So I\u2019ve decided to change that and start remembering the experience.  The first thing I want to make is that reading a book is much more like watching a movie than like reading a book.  When I read a book, I imagine myself in the story and I try to \u201csee\u201d what\u2019s happening around me.  This is much harder to do when watching a movie because you\u2019re \u201cseeing\u201d it through a screen.  It\u2019s much harder to get immersed.  The second point I want to make is that you should read books that interest you but not too many.  There\u2019s a lot of information that you can get from a book but you can only remember so much.  This is best explained by the \nPareto principle\n (80 20 rule), which states that 80% of your work gets 80% of the results.  This is definitely not the case with books.

Sometimes I feel \u201cobligated\u201d to read a book because it\u2019s an important subject or because I bought it already.  That\u2019s a pretty big fallacy.  You won\u2019t get much out of a book that you are \u201cforcing\u201d yourself to read.  You should especially follow this rule if you\u2019re part-way through a book.  My important takeaway was that I should stop as soon as possible so I don\u2019t \u201close momentum\u201d reading, getting to that point where it becomes a chore.  Reading is really about getting what you want to get out of the book.

I think I\u2019m hitting that point where I\u2019ve learned most of the \u201ceasy\u201d stuff and now I\u2019m starting to hit the \u201clong-tail\u201d (this is one of the topics I wanted to write about). For music, I think it\u2019s really solidifying some of the basics like pitch and rhythm, which should directly transfer to singing and playing at the same time. For Chinese, it\u2019s really learning that long-tail of words beyond everyday simple conversation. Finding time is probably the hardest thing for me nowadays but I\u2019m hopeful that I can make steady (if slow) progress on these two hobbies.

Everyone has different motivations, but one possible answer is that a Ph.D. program provides a safe environment for certain types of people to push themselves far beyond their mental limits and then emerge stronger as a result. For example, my six years of Ph.D. training have made me wiser, savvier, grittier, and more steely, focused, creative, eloquent, perceptive, and professionally effective than I was as a fresh college graduate. (Two obvious caveats: Not every Ph.D. student received these benefits \u2014 many grew jaded and burned-out from their struggles. Also, lots of people cultivate these positive traits without going through a Ph.D. program.) Here is an imperfect analogy: Why would anyone spend years training to excel in a sport such as the Ironman Triathlon \u2014 a grueling race consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run \u2014 when they aren\u2019t going to become professional athletes?
