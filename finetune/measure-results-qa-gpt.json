This year (especially in the last quarter), I\u2019ve skipped a lot of Chinese classes.  My excuse (as always) is that there were higher priority things going on, which is true to some extent.  However, I\u2019ve made some incremental progress.  I\u2019m a bit more comfortable speaking now, a combination of being a bit more confident and having a slightly larger vocabulary.  One realization that I came to is that I was doing too much indirect practice for my ultimate goal: conversing in Chinese.  Examples of indirect practice were primarily around reading and writing.  Next year, I\u2019m going to try to get more practice speaking to family members, but also potentially experimenting with native speakers online to get some more convenient directed practice.  Hopefully in next year\u2019s update I can tell you all about the success I\u2019ve had using this method.

This frequently-asked question is important because most Ph.D. graduates aren\u2019t able to get the same jobs as their university mentors and role models \u2014 tenure-track professors. There simply aren\u2019t enough available faculty positions, so most Ph.D. students are directly training for a job that they will never get. (Imagine how disconcerting it would be if medical or law school graduates couldn\u2019t get jobs as doctors or lawyers, respectively.)
